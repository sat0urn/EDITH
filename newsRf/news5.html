        In addition to residents of the Republic of Kazakhstan, persons of Kazakh nationality who do not live in

        <h3 class="subtitle_news">Aqyl deposit is designed to save money for the child's future higher education.</h3>
        <h1>Educational contribution</h1>
        <p class="text_news">The state education savings system will allow citizens to open Aqyl educational deposits in
          the future to pay for tuition in technical and vocational, post-secondary, higher and postgraduate (master's)
          educational programs in Kazakhstan.
          <br><br>
          The accumulation system is the most interesting component. Much depends on the timing of savings, government
          assistance, and the person's willingness to increase their savings. The advantage of an educational deposit is
          that you can make voluntary contributions at any time and in any amount.
          <br><br>
          The educational deposit is unique in that it includes a premium of 5% from the state for the entire amount of
          the deposit, taking into account not only bank interest, but also the bank's interest. The state premium for
          children with disabilities from large and low-income families, orphans, children left without parental care,
          is 7%.
        </p>
        <h1>What are the advantages?</h1>
        <p class="text_news">Educational deposit is subject to mandatory guarantee of deposits of individuals. This
          means that if you lose the license of the bank where you opened such a deposit, the money will be reimbursed
          to you, as they are guaranteed by the Deposit Insurance Fund of Kazakhstan. The maximum amount of payment is
          10 million tenge.
          <br><br>
          The educational deposit is a special account and is protected from any withdrawals by third parties. It is not
          banned or blocked.
          <br><br>
          You can open a Aqyl deposit in your own name or in the name of the child. Conveniently, the depositor can only
          be a person who wants to study and get an education. The main thing is to use the funds only for bachelor's
          and master's degrees. And if you or your child enrolls in a grant, you can receive all the savings, including
          bank fees and state bonuses, or spend the money to pay for a master's degree or transfer it to a third party.
        </p>
        <h1>Is it possible to withdraw money ahead of time?</h1>
        <p class="text_news">Yes, it can be done while keeping the bank's interest, but at the same time the state
          premium is lost, which is returned to the budget.
          <br><br>
          Requirements for educational deposits in the participating banks of the SSS:
        </p>
        <ul class="text_news">
          <li>annual effective interest rate (ANI) - up to 10%;</li>
          <li>state premium - 5 or 7% (7% - for orphans, children left without parental care, the disabled, children
            from large families and low-income families; 5% - for other categories of the population of the Republic of
            Kazakhstan).</li>
          <li>The state premium is calculated annually for the entire amount of the deposit, taking into account the
            bank's interest.</li>
